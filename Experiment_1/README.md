# Experiment 1: SPA vs MPA Project

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Understanding Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture**
   - Learn how SPAs dynamically load content without full page reloads using React Router, improving user experience and application responsiveness.

2. **Client-Side Routing Implementation**
   - Master the implementation of client-side routing using React Router DOM to create seamless navigation between different views/pages without server requests.

3. **Component-Based Development**
   - Develop skills in building reusable, modular React components (Home, About, Contact) and understanding component composition for maintainable applications.

4. **Performance and User Experience Benefits of SPAs**
   - Understand how SPAs reduce network traffic, provide faster navigation, and deliver a smoother user experience compared to traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs).

5. **State Management and Route Parameters**
   - Learn to manage application state effectively within a SPA and handle route parameters for dynamic content rendering across different components.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Single Page Application using React, Vite, and React Router DOM, showcasing the advantages of SPAs over traditional Multi-Page Application architectures.
